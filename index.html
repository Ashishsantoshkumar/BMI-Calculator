                body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
                determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point
                to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
            Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
            health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for
            a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
            ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
            physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
            week.

          <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
          <p>
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider
            their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
            beneficial to use.

              <h4>Gender</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
              with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
              when evaluating their BMI.

              <h4>Age</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
              BMI to underestimate body fat content.

              <h4>Muscle</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese,
              as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

            <p>
              Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
              baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to
              minimise health risks for both mother and child.

            <p>
              BMI doesn't show the proportion of fat, bone, and muscle.Two people can have the same BMI but very different body compositions â€” one may be fit, the other unhealthy.
